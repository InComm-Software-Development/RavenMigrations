Contributions of any size are welcome and encouraged. Contributions can come in
the form of comments, issues, pull requests, etc. If you haven't yet, please read
the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Comments/Code Reviews

Check out any outstanding issues or pull requests and contribute through
constructive questions, suggestions, and discussions. When reviewing pull
requests, pay attention to style, correctness, readability, etc. See the section
on pull requests below.

## Issues

Submit issues for any bugs you've found or suggestions you have for the code. Be
sure to check first to see if your issue has already been reported.

## Pull requests

Submit a pull request for any existing or new issue. The maintainers will strive
to give feedback as quickly as possible. All are encouraged to comment on and
discuss any open pull requests, as long as the discussion adheres to the
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The following is a checklist to refer to
when submitting or reviewing a pull request.

1. Unit tests - Please write tests for all changes.
1. Code style - Follow the code style present in the repository. If a more
   detailed style guide becomes necessary, it can be added.
1. Commits - Provide detailed and properly formatted commit messages. Check out [5
   Useful Tips For A Better Commit Message](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).
1. Versioning - The project maintainers should handle releases and version changes
   associated with them. For more information, see the [maintaining
   guide](./MAINTAINING.md).
1. Please update the [Change Log](./CHANGELOG.md) for any noteworthy changes. The
   latest version will appear as [x.x.x] until a maintainer updates it for
   deployment.
